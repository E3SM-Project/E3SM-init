These files are copied from Chad Sockwell's home directory on lcrc, which were
moved to /lcrc/group/e3sm/ac.sockwell/home to allow access to them after his
untimely passing. Chad had been working on a process for spinning up the E3SM
model by alternating between F- and G-cases. It's unclear how far he got, but 
we are saving these files in case someone else picks up this work and might
find something useful here.
