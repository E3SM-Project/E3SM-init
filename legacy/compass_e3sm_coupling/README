***********************WARNING***************************
The e3sm_coupling step is a work in progress, and is not
fully functional. Use at this point is intended only for
testing purposes.
*********************************************************

The create_E3SM_coupling_files.py should be run after spinning up an MPAS-Ocean
initial condition using the COMPASS infrastructure.  Configuration is controlled
by config files defaults.ini and config_E3SM_coupling_files.ini.  The former
can just be copied or linked as is, while the latter is intended to be edited
for a specific mesh and initial condition.

The script expects a local file called "mesh_before_metadata.nc" that contains
the full MPAS-Ocean mesh including the vertical coordinate.  This could be an
initial state or a restart file from a spun-up initial condition.

Additionally, the "initial_condition" config option should point to the spun-up
initial condition.  (This could be the same as "mesh_before_metadata.nc".)

The script adds standard MPAS-Ocean mesh metadata to the NetCDF file before
creating:
* oocean initial condition files for E3SM
* ocean graph partition files
* sea-ice initial condition files for E3SM
* ocean scrip files
* region masks for MPAS-Ocean analysis members
* mapping files for MPAS-Analysis

There is draft functionality for creating other mapping and domain files in the
script, but this is largely untested and not currently recommended.

After running create_E3SM_coupling_files.py, the directory
assembled_files_for_upload is populated with links. The directory structure is
identical to the E3SM inputdata directory found here:
https://web.lcrc.anl.gov/public/e3sm/inputdata/

The linked  file names are correct and ready for the inputdata repo. To grab
them all, you can use the commands:
   cd assembled_files_for_upload
   tar cvf inputdata.tar inputdata -h
and then copy the tar file to another machine.

E3SM members should consult with an expert from the team to get help and
approval before moving files to the data server.  Currently, the files produced
here are not ready for includsion in E3SM and should not be uploaded. In the
future, when this process produces a usable set of input files, experts may
upload the data to the LCRC inputdata server by following instructions here:
