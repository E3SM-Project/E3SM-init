Topography generation.

atm-topo-v2-quasiuniform.sh:
  Andrew M. Bradley (ambradl@sandia.gov)
  Procedure used to generate the ne30 topo for v2. See numbered comments in the
script describing each step.
  Dependencies:
    1. TempestRemap. Usually availabe in ~zender/bin. Otherwise, clone from
          https://github.com/ClimateGlobalChange/tempestremap
       and build following the instructions on that page.
    2. cube_to_target. cd to
         ${E3SM}/components/eam/tools/topo_tool/cube_to_target
       and follow the instructions in README.md there to build cube_to_target.
    3. homme_tool. Make a build directory outside of ${E3SM}. Run cmake:
          rm -rf CMake*
          cmake \
              -C ${E3SM}/components/homme/cmake/machineFiles/compy-intel.cmake \
              ${E3SM}/components/homme
       Then build homme_tool:
          make -j4 homme_tool
       This builds src/tool/homme_tool.
In the script, see the section starting "## Dependencies:" for links to each of
these.
